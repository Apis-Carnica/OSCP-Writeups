# OSCP-Writeups
A collection of stories to read to your last braincell (OSCP lab machine writeups). 

***

### Organization

  The writeups hosted on this repo are only PDFs; if you'd like a more interactive experience, please check out [**the website**](https://oscp.artiotech.org) to see more pretty versions of this documentation. The only downside is that the webpages are only in English, where the PDF writeups are in Spanish and Japanese as well.

***

Due to how long the Spanish and Japanese versions take to translate, I'll upload those writeups after my exam so I have more time to study. Please take a look at DC-1's multilingual writeups as an example for the future.
